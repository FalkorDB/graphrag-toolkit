relation_selection_prompt: '''
    Your task is to select the most appropriate relations based on their relevance to a given question. 

    ### Formatting Requirements:
    1. Each selected relation and score MUST be on a new line
    2. Do not use commas, semicolons, or any other delimiters between relations or scores


    Follow these steps:
    1. Read the provided <question>question</question> carefully.
    2. Analyze each relation in the <relation> list and determine its relevance to the question and relation.
    3. Respond by selecting the most relevant relations within <select>relations</select> tags. Be both frugal on your selection and consider completeness.
    4. The selected relations should be provided line-by-line.
    

    Example format:
    <question>
    Name the president of the country whose main spoken language was English in 1980?
    </question>

    <entity>
    English Language
    English
    </entity>

    <relations>
    language.human_language.main_country
    language.human_language.language_family
    language.human_language.iso_639_3_code
    base.rosetta.languoid.parent
    language.human_language.countries_spoken_in
    </relations>

    <selected>
    language.human_language.main_country
    base.rosetta.languoid.parent
    language.human_language.countries_spoken_in
    </selected>

    Explanation: language.human_language.main_country relation is highly relevant as it directly relates to the country whose president is being asked for, and the main country where English language is spoken in 1980.
    language.human_language.countries_spoken_in relation is also relevant as it provides information on the countries where English language is spoken, which could help narrow down the search for the president.
    base.rosetta.languoid.parent relation is less relevant but still provides some context on the language family

    Important Instructions: Always return at least one relation.
    Now it is your turn. 

    <question>
    {question}
    </question>

    <entity>
    {entity}
    </entity>

    <relations>
    {relations}
    </relations>

    Remember to parse your response in <selected></selected> tags:

entity_selection_prompt: '''
  Given a question and the associated retrieved knowledge graph context (entity, relation, entity), you are asked to select the most important entities to explore in order to answer the question.
  Consider important entities only that are necessary for answering the question. Do not select entities, for which we already have all necessary information.

  - Format your response exactly as follows:
    <next-entities>
    relevant_entity1
    relevant_entity2
      ...
    </next-entities>
  
   The selected entities must be provided line-by-line (\n).

  Example format:
    Question: Name the president of the country whose main spoken language was English in 1980?
    Graph Context: English Language -> language.human_language.countries_spoken_in -> England | USA

    <next-entities>
    England
    USA
    </next-entities>


  The entites should be sorted from the most important to the least important. 
  Important Instruction: If we can answer the question directly based on the provided graph context, respond with:
  <next-entities>
  FINISH
  </next-entities>

  - Now Respond ONLY to the requested tasks with proper tags
